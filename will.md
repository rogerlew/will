# Last Will and Testament

I, Roger Thomas Lew, of Latah County, Idaho, being of sound mind and under no undue influence, make my last will and testament, revoking all previous wills and codicils.

I direct that all my just debts and funeral expenses be paid as soon after my death as possible, and that all expenses of administering my estate taxes be paid out of my residuary estate.

I appoint Tara Lew as my personal representative, to serve without bond. If she is unable to serve, I appoint Dulce Kersting-Lark as my personal representative, also to serve without bond.

If my spouse fails to survive me, I give the residue of my estate as follows:

If my spouse fails to survive me, I give the following personal and household effects as follows:

The remaining personal and household effects shall be disposed at the discretion of my personal representative.
